excerpt: "There once was..."

## There once was...

There once was a man from Kalamazoo<br />
a dirty mind, why look at you?<br />
For did you think this poem was dirty?<br />
How old are we now? 20 - 30?<br />

No age restriction on rhyme or diction<br />
it helps the mind to wander<br />
a stinking pile of cow manure<br />
have we now filled expectations?<br />

Expectations do not help<br />
except in suffering<br />
life will never fulfill your dreams<br />
but will always keep you guessing.<br />

Guessing is a game we play<br />
when trying to pass some time<br />
at work, at home, love-life, alone<br />
fruitless as it may.<br />
