Another drink?!

"Decidedly so", said the oscelot though
his tuxedo was a mess.
"Without a doubt this round-a-bout
caused the vomit on our dress!"

"Was more than that, not tit-for-tat!",
said the lion to his mistress,
"That lush oh he'd been drinkin see,
We partied late this Christmas!"

It all began in north Japan,
the saki bombs were flowing,
then on the streets, a cab with beats,
not knowing where they're going.

The group of four had asked for more,
this night they would remember
"We're having so much fun tonight!"
A jolly drunk December
