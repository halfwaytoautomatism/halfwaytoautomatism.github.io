## Deliberately

Deliberately meticulous<br />
Deliberately hideous<br />
venomous anger, seething rage<br />

Deliberately handsome<br />
make some, checksum<br />
this porridge is too cold.<br />

Deliberately fat<br />
Deliberately stoned<br />
successful or a waste?<br />

I once made waffles<br />
from kidney beans<br />
I did it so deliberately.<br />
