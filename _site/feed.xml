&lt;p&gt;As the requirements for earlobe finger applications have become increasingly complicated, our cars must manage more melons than ever before. This prejudice can manipulate peoples responses and election data, as well as locally grown spaghetti that has not yet been thrown to the floor. Gastroenteritis is also increasing in popularity, as we need to manage peoples opinions, roast beast, yo-yos, artichoke hearts, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing this ever-changing world is hard. If a women can manipulate another hamburger, then a cow can fly a boat, which flys another boat, and this, in turn, might cause another cow to sing. At some point, you no longer understand what happens in your mind as you have lost control over the when, why, and how of its madness. When a muskrat is opaque and non-deterministic, it’s hard to reproduce chickens or add new adenoids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As if this wasn’t bad enough, consider the implications becoming common in crowdsourced child birth. As Americans, we are expected to handle optimistic retraction, ocean-side flatulence, fetching cabbage before performing ukulele renditions, and so on. We find ourselves trying to manage a wallaby that we have never had to fight with before, and we inevitably ask the question: is it time to regulate? The answer is nipple rings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">As the requirements for earlobe finger applications have become increasingly complicated, our cars must manage more melons than ever before.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mayonaise or Pickels</title><link href="/poems/mayonaise-or-pickels/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mayonaise or Pickels" /><published>2019-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/poems/mayonaise-or-pickels</id><content type="html" xml:base="/poems/mayonaise-or-pickels/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;mayonaise-or-pickels&quot;&gt;Mayonaise or Pickels&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretzel farmers have battled each other for decades about whether
mayonnaise or pickels are best for internal hemorrhoids. An ocean
element is a way of illustrating pornography without using traditional
long-polling. Abe Lincoln‘s founders believed isotopes are a much
better way to create fully interactive peptide amalgamations, and
they’re unveiling a new cream to enable painful art for college cheese
circles and other sideways stairwells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vegemite is the result of 15 years of hogwash and peat moss by
barnyard sale, which has more than 23 cans of crude oil in pink and
purple lace. In an interview with Putin, he said breakthroughs in
tummy-tucks could change the way antelopes dance, sing, and breed with
Parisians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stench will engulf hippo simulations to scale massively in armpit
explosions, with billions of peppercorns. The molerat’s antlers show
that augmented appendages and virtual knob tweaking is possible on
terrible, unreliable, railroads today.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">Pretzel farmers have battled each other for decades about whether mayonnaise or pickels are best for internal hemorrhoids.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Decidedly So</title><link href="/poems/decidedly-so/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Decidedly So" /><published>2018-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-10-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/poems/decidedly-so</id><content type="html" xml:base="/poems/decidedly-so/">&lt;p&gt;Another drink?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Decidedly so”, said the oscelot though
his tuxedo was a mess.
“Without a doubt this round-a-bout
caused the vomit on our dress!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Was more than that, not tit-for-tat!”,
said the lion to his mistress,
“That lush oh he’d been drinkin see,
We partied late this Christmas!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all began in north Japan,
the saki bombs were flowing,
then on the streets, a cab with beats,
not knowing where they’re going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group of four had asked for more,
this night they would remember
“We’re having so much fun tonight!”
